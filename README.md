# Fashion_Image_classifcation
This exploration design addresses the development and perpetration of a Convolutional Neural Network( CNN) for fashion item bracket using the Fashion MNIST 
dataset. The problem at hand involves creating an accurate model to automatically classify colorful apparel and appurtenant orders grounded on image data. The 
exploration employs a structured approach, encompassing data lading, preprocessing, and the construction of a CNN model with convolutional and thick layers. 
The training process involves optimizing the model using the Adam optimizer and meager categorical cross entropy loss function. Through ten ages of training, 
the model achieves an emotional delicacy of roughly 90 on the test data. The findings emphasize the efficacity of the CNN armature in automating the recognition 
of different fashion particulars. In conclusion, the exploration contributes a well- performing model to the field of image bracket, showcasing the eventuality for 
automated fashion categorization using deep literacy ways.
